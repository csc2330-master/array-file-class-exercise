# array-file-class-exercise

A Store Owner wants you to create a program that will have a list of products with its prices. You will load the names of the products and their prices into two arrays: `products` and `prices`. After loading this information you will then start "selling."

A list of the products will be displayed on the screen, the user can select a product and then specify the desired quantity of this product. The user will continue to select products until they don't want to continue.

Finally, your program will show the invoice, and it will save this invoice into a file called `invoice.txt`. Both invoices should be neatly formatted.

As an exercise for you:
* How could we save all the invoices for all the customers?
* Would it be possible to not have two arrays for the products' names and their prices?
*
